## Final Project - DTK Solutions

Stuart Smith originally brought the idea for this website to me after learning I am studying web design at UC. At the time I was in my first semester of school, but I told him when I'm farther along it's something I'd like to do for him. Now that we're working on the final project for Web II, I felt this was the perfect opportunity.

* My intention for this website is to make it look professional and competative with the other local plumber websites in the Cincinnati area. 
* It will give a full scope of the services they offer, explain how to get those services, and explain the pricing structure.
